I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis. My research interests cover knowledge graphs and distributed systems (workflows, provenance) in the context of life sciences. 

From 2018 to 2020, I co-lead the INEXMED integrative bioinformatics project funded by IFB (Institut Français de Bioinformatique) to design a FAIR data infrastructure bridging imaging and sequencing data. 

Since 2019 I co-lead the IFB interoperability working group and represents the french activities in this domain for the European ELIXIR infrastructure. 

Since 2020, I co-lead the R2P2 interdisciplinary project funded by CNRS, and aimed at better sharing and citing scientific workflows.
