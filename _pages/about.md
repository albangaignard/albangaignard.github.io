I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis. My research interests cover knowledge graphs and distributed systems (workflows, provenance) in the context of life sciences. 

I'm involved in several national and international projects in the context of biomedical data integration and sharing such as the PEPR Santé-numérique (ShareFAIR and Neurovasc programmes), the PPR ABRomics, and the ANR MeKaNo.

I co-lead the IFB "interoperability" and "health" working groups and represents the french activities in these domains for the European ELIXIR infrastructure.
