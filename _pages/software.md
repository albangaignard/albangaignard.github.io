### [FAIR-Checker](https://fair-checker.france-bioinformatique.fr)
A generic tool aimed at assessing FAIR principles and empowering data providers and developers to enhance the quality of their digital resources. Data providers and consumers can check how FAIR are web resources. Developers can explore and get insights in the quality of metadata exposed by web resources.  

FAIR-Checker is one of the key resources of the Elixir-FR service delivery plan. It is running in production to serve thousands of FAIR-assessments per month. It is supported by the infrastructure itself (permanent FTE) and by software developers recruited through funded projects (national grant PIA2 11-INBS-0013)

### [Shema.org Observatory](https://schema-obs-demo.onrender.com) 
A web application that allows to explore the schema.org vocabulary and its usage in the wild. 
We computed a summary (Characteristic Sets) based on the WebDataCommons dataset. This allows to show the most used (top-10) combination of Schema.org properties for all 700+ Schema.org classes. 

More details here: [[paper](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3632/ISWC2023_paper_445.pdf)], [[poster](/assets/pdf/ISWC2023-Poster.pdf)].  

The characteristic sets can be downloaded at [https://zenodo.org/record/8167689](https://zenodo.org/record/8167689.).

Source code is available at [https://github.com/albangaignard/schema-obs-demo](https://github.com/albangaignard/schema-obs-demo). 

### [RIA-predict](https://github.com/ICAN-aneurysms/RIA-predict) 
An algorithm to generated synthetic clinical data for Intracranial Aneurysms patients based on probability distributions. This code supports the paper "Location of intracranial aneurysms is the main factor associated with rupture in the ICAN population" published at [https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/92/2/122.abstract](https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/92/2/122.abstract).

### [PyBRAVO](https://github.com/pyBRAvo/pyBRAvo)
A Python implementation of BRAvo [[https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa113](https://doi.org/10.1093/database/baaa113)], an algorithm aimed at reconstructing upstream regulation networks from the [PathwayCommons](https://www.pathwaycommons.org) knowledge base. pyBRAvo can be used through either a Jupyter notebook, or a command line interface. 

More details at [https://github.com/pyBRAvo/pyBRAvo](https://github.com/pyBRAvo/pyBRAvo).

### [INEX-MED](https://inexmed-api.univ-nantes.fr)
A knowledge graph integrating clinical, omics and imaging data in the context of intracranial aneurysms. 

More details at [https://inexmed.univ-nantes.fr/doku.php](https://inexmed.univ-nantes.fr/doku.php). 

### [Snakemake-prov](https://bitbucket.org/agaignar/snakemake-provenance/src/provenance-capture/)
An extension of the SnakeMake workflow engine to track provenance metadata at runtime and serialize it in RDF (PROV-O ontology) 

The code is available at [https://bitbucket.org/agaignar/snakemake-provenance/src/provenance-capture/](https://bitbucket.org/agaignar/snakemake-provenance/src/provenance-capture/)

### [FRESH](https://github.com/albangaignard/fresh-toolbox)
A demonstration supporting the [Semantic Web journal paper](https://semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj2257.pdf) on annotating workflow provenance traces with domain-specific ontologies. 

More details at [https://github.com/albangaignard/fresh-toolbox](https://github.com/albangaignard/fresh-toolbox). 

### [SHARP](https://github.com/albangaignard/sharp-prov-toolbox)
A demonstration supporing the [ESWC paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70407-4_35) on provenance traces harmonization based on logical rules.
